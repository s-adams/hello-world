# hello-world
All the things.
I need to come clean that the last time I committed code to a production enviornment was in C in 2003.  Having developed skills at communcation between the engineering teams and executive business folks, my career moved off into areas that maximized those skills.  However, I think that understanding Github is essential, so I am learning.  Please, be merciful.
